                    I have been browsing the Internet for my whole life, and have found some interesting websites along the way! If you like Argyle, you'll probably enjoy these. And don't worry - none of these are affiliates!
                    <h4><a href="https://www.totallyuselesswebsites.com"> Totally Useless Websites</a></h4>
                    This website is a list of the many larks that humanity gets up to when given a computer and free time. Any of the links will likely provide you with hours of mindless fun!
                    <h4> <a href="https://www.sporcle.com/"> Sporcle</a></h4>
                    If you are into trivia, this is the site for you. Find a community of people who have collectively produced over one million quizzes!
                    <h4> <a href="https://plink.in/"> Plink</a></h4>

                    <h4> <a href="http://theofficestaremachine.com/"> The Office Stare Machine</a></h4>
                    I am a major The Office fan, and one of the best parts is the 4th-wall breaking stares at the camera. On this site you can input any emotion, and it will output a series of stares from The Office that fit that emotion!

                    The most poignant entry of all. See videos that people bothered to post to YouTube, but which have recieved no attention from any other living soul.
